The Library Management System is a full-stack web application built with Spring Boot, React.js, and MySQL to manage library resources efficiently. It allows users to add, update, delete, and search for books. The frontend, styled with Material-UI and animated using Framer Motion, ensures a smooth user experience. The backend, powered by Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA, communicates seamlessly via a RESTful API. Users can set up the project by configuring MySQL credentials and running the backend with Maven and the frontend with Node.js. The system supports API testing via Postman and is open for contributions on GitHub.![Screenshot (9)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc844072-3abb-4912-8c23-5c182252b71b)
